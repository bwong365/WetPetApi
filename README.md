# WetPetApi
### WetPetApi allows you to register pets in various locations, and check up on their needs, relative to the weather.

- WetPetApi was really an excuse to build a whimsically themed API using Clean Architecture and DDD principles.
- Integration with Auth0 will come while the front-end is developed
