# WetPetApi

## WetPetApi allows you to register pets in various locations, and check up on their needs, relative to the weather.

The app can be found at [https://wet-pet-ui.fly.dev](https://wet-pet-ui.fly.dev)

Frontend repo is at https://github.com/bwong365/wet-pet-ui

- WetPetApi was really an excuse to build a whimsically themed API using Clean Architecture and DDD principles.
